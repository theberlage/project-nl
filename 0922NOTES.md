# Feedbacks for Jules and Bert

## feedback 1: Layer Management

**Need: Allowing different categorization system of annotation when editing and viewing**
 More options to choose what can be visible. For example: based on time period, different themes, etc.

Current Issue:
- eidting stage via Placemarker
No way to save layers in geojson file, compilation becomes quite tedious. (If map layer visibility synchronization can be solved, then inability to save in layers would be a minor problem.)
