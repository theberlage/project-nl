# Feedbacks for Jules and Bert

## feedback 1: Layer Management

**Need: Allowing different categorization system of annotation when editing and viewing**
 More options to choose what can be visible. For example: based on time period, different themes, etc.

Current Issue:
- editing stage via Placemarker
No way to save layers in geojson file, compilation becomes quite tedious. (If map layer visibility synchronization can be solved, then inability to save in layers would be a minor problem.)

- managing by internal layers or "properties" when exporting from Placemark to GeoJson. We would like to be able to sort by property (like in Excel), but have not figured out a good way to manage this. 

- multiple users on the same map. Although it is a good tool for us to discuss, editing a map while others are on it is very difficult because layers will open and close when others use it at the same time. We were wondering if a duplicate workflow is best for editing? We have been working like this during rushed deadlines because it allows us all to work at once.


## Placemark team access GitHub 
Chao recieved access to the Placemark github, and we are confused what this means and what we should or should not do with it. We do not want to mess anything up for the app, and we are wondering if there is a reason for our access.

If any of the previously problems can be easily solved through Placemark access, please let us know.
